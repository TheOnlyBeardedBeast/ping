# Ping

is a an electromechanical tabble tennis game like the Atari pong table.

WORK IN PROGRESS

## About

This is a 2 player game, each player controls a paddle, the paddles are passing a ball between each other. If a player misses to catch the ball, the other player gets a point.

Each paddle is controlled with a nema17 motor, and a rotary encoder sets the speed and the direction of the paddle. The ball is controlled with 2 nema17 motors so it can move on 2 axes.

## Parts

- 4 x Nema17 Stepper motor
- 2 x E38S6G5-600B-G24N Rotary encoder
- 1 x CNC shield V3.0
- 4 x A4988 stepper motor driver
- 1 x Arduino due (probably will upgrade to Giga)
- 1 X 24V 5A PSU (120W)

## Progress

Currently the paddle implementation is done and working.
