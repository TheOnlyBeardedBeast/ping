## About

This is a 2 player game, each player controls a paddle, the paddles are passing a ball between each other. If a player misses to catch the ball, the other player gets a point.

Each paddle is controlled with a nema17 motor and a rotary encoder sets the speed and the direction of the paddle. The ball is controlled with 2 nema17 motors so it can move on 2 axes.

Currently the paddle implementation is done and working.
